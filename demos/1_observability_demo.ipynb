    "|------|------------|---------------------|\n",
    "| 1. Created UDF | `categorize_support_level()` function | Logs + Traces for each categorization |\n",
    "| 2. Tested UDF | Ran with 3 different scenarios | Generated telemetry for each test |\n",

    "| 4. Created Procedure | `process_family_intakes()` batch processor | Logs + Traces at every step |\n",

    "## Key Takeaways for Understood\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "- **Debug issues faster:** When a family isn't processed correctly, trace back through logs\n",
    "- **Monitor performance:** CPU/memory metrics show if processing is efficient\n",
    "- **Audit trail:** Every action is recorded with timestamps and details\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Use This in Production\n",
    "1. **UDFs** - For reusable business logic (categorization, scoring, validation)\n",
    "2. **Stored Procedures** - For batch operations (nightly processing, data pipelines)\n",
    "3. **Event Table** - Query with SQL for debugging, monitoring, and reporting\n",

    "### Observability Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "| Method | What It Captures | When to Use |\n",
    "|--------|-----------------|-------------|\n",
    "| `logging.info()` | Text messages | Debugging, status updates |\n",
    "| `telemetry.set_span_attribute()` | Key-value data | Input/output values, IDs |\n",
    "| `telemetry.add_event()` | Named events with data | Milestones, completion markers |\n",
    "| *(automatic)* | CPU/memory metrics | Always captured when enabled |"
